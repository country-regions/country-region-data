# country-region-data

This repo provides country and region data in three different formats: es6, UMD (Unified Module Definition) and
plain JSON. The data contains country names, country short codes, country regions, and country region short
codes. All country names and short codes are guaranteed to be unique. Similarly, all regions and region short
codes _within a single country_ are guaranteed to be unique.

Countries can subdivide themselves in all sorts of different ways, often overlapping. They may have states, provinces,
regions, districts, municipalities, and more. The goal of this repo was to house whatever subdivisions makes sense from
the viewpoint of _addressing_, and for that we use [ISO-3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2).

The raw data here is used for the [country-region-selector](https://github.com/country-regions/country-region-selector),
[react-country-region-selector](https://github.com/country-regions/react-country-region-selector) scripts but can be used
independently for whatever you want.

### Install

This package is available as an npm package. Install with your package manager of choice:

```
pnpm install country-region-data
yarn add country-region-data
npm install country-region-data
```

### Structure

See the `data.json` file in the root folder for the raw data. The JSON is of the form:

```javascript
[
  {
    "countryName": "Ecuador",
    "countryShortCode": "EC",
    "regions": [
      {
        "name": "Azuay",
        "shortCode": "A"
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```

The `data.json` file is the source of truth for the data set, but the generated build artifacts (not seen the repo -
only in the npm package) are:

```
dist/data.js
dist/data-umd.js
```

The first one is an es6 file containing all the data in tree-shakeable format; the second is a UMD file containing the
entire content. As of 3.0.0, the `main` package.json entry links to the UMD format and the `module` entry
links to the es6 format.

### How to use

The es6 file can be imported like so:

```jsx harmony
import { allCountries } from 'country-region-data';
```

If you're using typescript you'll get all the typings and see the structure of the exported data in your IDE. If not,
check your node_modules/country-region-data/dist folder and look at the `data.d.ts` file to get the full list of exported
information.

The UMD file can be used like this:

```jsx harmony
import countryRegionData from 'country-region-data/dist/data-umd';
```

The raw JSON like this:

```jsx harmony
const json = require('country-region-data/data.json');
```

Note I slipped into CJS there - node lets you read JSON files by default, so if you want in es6 format (`import json from X`),
you'll need to configure your system (webpack, rollup etc.) with a loader/plugin to let it read JSON directly.

### Typings

There are three different formats for the repo data: JSON, UMD and ES6. I figure es6 is going to be the most likely
used format, so the generated typings file (`dist/data.d.ts`) is for the es6 version, and referenced in the "typings"
property in the package.json file. It should be automatically picked up by your IDEs.

There are no typings for the UMD or JSON format.

### Contribute

Make your changes to the `data.json` file in the root folder.

Updates and fixes to the data is much appreciated! The region abbreviations in particular are not yet complete, so
the more contributors the better. Regions that need ISO-3166-2 codes can be identified by having a missing `shortCode`
property for each region. You can find them by cloning the repo, then running:

```
yarn install
npx grunt findIncomplete
```

That'll list all countries with regions that are missing region short codes. Wikipedia has a lot of the data listed here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2

### Data Validation

Before contributing a PR, please validate the JSON content (if you don't, Travis will catch it for you!). To do that,
run the following on your command line:

```
yarn install
npx grunt validate
```

That'll throw an error if the JSON is invalid or if some duplicate names were accidentally introduced. The error messages
are pretty clear, I think.

### Changelog

Note that this repo does _not_ use semantic versioning. I realize that's pretty non-standard, but every change
to this repo is a dataset change which is technically backward incompatible. So although we could be bumping
the major version with each release, I think that that would be more problematic: apps can no longer use the `~` and
`^` chars in their package.json files to get the latest content so updates would be manual and frequent.

- `3.2.0` - Oct 22, 2025 - Hungary, UK, Chile, Norway data updated.

  - **Breaking change**: the package.json file for this repo now added a `module` entry to link to the es6 format; the older
    `main` entry links to the older UMD format. This should work for all bundlers, but let us know if you encounter problems.
